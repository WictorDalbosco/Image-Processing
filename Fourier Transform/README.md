# Fourier Transformations

The implementation of this code used the understanding of the frequency
domain of images and how to use Fourier Transform and filtering techniques to match
the expected results.

The main task is to match a set of given images using 7 filters in the frequency
domain.

The different ideal filters implemented:

a) Ideal Low-pass;
b) Ideal High-pass;
c) Ideal Band-pass;
d) Laplacian high-pass;
e) Gaussian Low-pass;
f) Butterworth low-pass;
g) Butterworth high-pass;
