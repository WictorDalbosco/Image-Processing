# Enhancement and Superresolution


Implement 3 distinct image enhancement techniques, as well as a superresolution method based on multiple views of the same image.

The techniques are:

1. Histogram-based Enhancement:

       Option 1: Single-image Cumulative Histogram 

       Option 2: Joint Cumulative Histogram

2. Gamma Correction: Implement the pixel-wise enhancement
function

- After calculation of this filters, apply the superresolution and compare with the origina image.

- This task werer programmed using  python 3 and the libraries numpy and imageio
