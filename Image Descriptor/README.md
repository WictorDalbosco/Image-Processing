# Image descriptors with  Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG)

This feature extractor was first introduced by Dalal and Triggs for human
detection in CCTV images. We will follow their steps and implement a solution for 
the same task using both the descriptor and the Machine Learning algorithm K-nearest-neighbours. 

Solution implemented with python 3 and the libraries numpy,
imageio and scipy
